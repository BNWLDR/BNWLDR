Hello, Iâ€™m Boone, a student at UNT studying Computer Science. My expected graduation date is May 2025, and I'm excited to start a new career as a software engineer.
In addition to experience with C++ and Java, I'm currently learning javascript/React and Python.
I'm working on a few projects in addition to coursework, mostly a website hosted on my home computer that will also serve as a showcase for projects that I work on.
